        I led the end-to-end redesign of YooMoney‚Äôs web and mobile payment forms, driving a 12% conversion lift for the Web Widget and 5% for the Mobile SDK. Through user interviews, usability testing, and data analysis, I identified key pain points and iterated core flows. I supported merchant growth by 78% and created a scalable, customisable solution adopted by leading brands.

        <li>Integrate new payment methods, such as SberPay and linked cards.</li>

        <li>Early-stage technical checks filtered out impractical concepts.</li>
        <li>Animations were developed directly in Codesandbox to streamline implementation.</li>

      <h3>Successful A/B testing</h3>
      <p>A limited beta launch involving 100 merchants validated the redesign through A/B testing:</p>

        <li>Merchants praised the improved visual design.</li>
        <li>Conversion rates increased by 10% due to enhanced focus during data entry.</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Final Launch Achievements</h3>
      <p>The final launch successfully met all objectives and delivered a measurable impact:</p>
      <ol class="description-list">
        <li><strong>Modernised User Interface:</strong> Enhanced usability and streamlined the payment process.</li>
        <li><strong>Step-by-Step Data Entry:</strong> Improved user focus, boosting conversion rates by 12% and generating an additional $450K in monthly revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Enabled merchants to add features like loyalty programmes, customise widget designs, and adapt functionality, leading to a 20% higher conversion rate for customised widgets.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Concept Adoption:</strong> The redesigned UX concept was reused across 8 company projects, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness.</li>
