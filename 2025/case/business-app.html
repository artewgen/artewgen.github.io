        I launched a business management app for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), achieving a 4.7 App Store rating, 27,000 B2B clients, and over 100,000 downloads in the first year. 
        The app introduced gesture-controlled dashboards, analytics-first UX, and rapid invoicing. That’s all driven by deep user research and continuous design iteration.

    <div id="rd-problems" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Merchant Problems: Mobile Access Limitations</h2>
      <p>YooMoney initially offered only a web-based merchant account, with no adaptive or mobile version available. Merchants frequently voiced frustration at being unable to access key features on the go, but simply adapting the website was technically and functionally unfeasible. This led to creating native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and iPad.</p>
      <p>I conducted about 20 user interviews, where merchants highlighted their most significant needs for mobile:</p>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Instant access to payment and sales analytics.</li>
        <li>Full control over payments with advanced search and filtering.</li>
        <li>Fast, seamless creation of invoices and processing of refunds.</li>
        <li>Direct access to customer support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">🧭</span>This research shaped a roadmap, ensuring the mobile apps delivered meaningful value rather than just a scaled-down web experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-adaptation" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Adaptation: Rethinking Business Tools for Mobile</h2>
      <p>
        When transitioning the established YooMoney web service to mobile, the challenge was not to recreate desktop workflows but to thoughtfully reimagine core business management functionalities for mobile devices' constraints and unique possibilities.
      <p>
        Instead of simply copying web layouts, I reimagined the information architecture and prioritised high-frequency actions like analytics, payments, and invoicing. This meant simplifying navigation, designing gesture-based interactions, and optimising onboarding for speed. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-analytics" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Analytics in Focus</h2>
      <p>In the initial release, the main screen displayed a list of payments, with analytics on the second tab. From early user reviews, I learned that merchants were accessing analytics more frequently than the payments list. In response, analytics was moved to the primary position in the next update, and users welcomed the change.</p>
      <p>The analytics dashboard featured nine key metrics: revenue, average check size, refund amount and count, number of payments, paid bills, average bill receipt, invoices issued, and unpaid bills.</p>
      <p>Users especially appreciated the ability to compare data via an interactive chart that could be expanded in horizontal mode—a feature that received consistently high ratings and positive feedback.</p>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">📈</span> Many merchants shared that they opened the app first thing in the morning to check analytics, treating it as their business dashboard. After moving analytics to the main screen, daily active sessions increased by 35%.
    </div>
    <div id="rd-payments" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Fast Payment Actions</h2>
      <p>The payments section provided merchants with a comprehensive, searchable list of all transactions, putting essential information at their fingertips. Merchants could confirm or cancel payments, review detailed histories, and search for specific transactions easily.</p>
      <p>Users could see a complete timeline for each payment: payment status, receipt issuance, and any associated refunds. The ability to quickly view and send receipts proved especially valuable, becoming one of merchants' most requested and well-used features.</p>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">🎯</span> A lot of users highlighted frustration with web-based workflows that buried transaction details several clicks deep. Surfacing this data on one screen and enabling actions with minimal taps was a major usability win on mobile.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-invoicing" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Instant Invoicing and Refunds</h2>
      <p>The app made invoicing fast and effortless—merchants could generate and send invoices instantly via email, SMS, or a direct link, allowing buyers to pay on the spot from any device. Once a payment was received, the merchant was notified with a push notification, keeping cash flow up to date in real time.</p>
      <p>Merchants also had the flexibility to issue full or partial refunds and could set expiration dates for invoices, preventing payments after a specified deadline.</p>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">⏱️</span> User research showed that merchants wasted time tracking unpaid invoices on desktops. The app helped them speed up payment collection by streamlining invoicing and adding real-time mobile notifications.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-support" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Real-Time Merchant Support</h2>
      <p>After hearing the need during user interviews, I added real-time support chat to the app. This allowed merchants to get help without leaving their workflow and made support faster and more effective by letting them send messages, screenshots, and transaction details directly to the support team.</p>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">💬</span> By embedding chat within the mobile app, average support response times were reduced by 35%, and merchant satisfaction scores increased significantly.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-tablet" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Tablet Version</h2>
      <p>Merchants frequently requested a tablet version, as many managed operations and reviewed analytics on larger screens during meetings or on the go. Adding a tablet-optimised experience helped power users handle complex workflows more efficiently and drove higher engagement among businesses using tablet devices.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="section-results">
    <div id="results-achievements" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Outstanding Launch Achievements</h2>
      <p>The app delivered merchants fast, convenient access to their accounts—and all essential business features—right from their mobile and tablet devices. With an emphasis on intuitive analytics dashboards and gesture-based controls, the app made exploring financial data engaging and straightforward.</p>
      <ol class="description-list"></ol>
        <li>Achieved a 4.7 App Store rating.</li>
        <li>Gained over 27,000 business clients.</li>
        <li>Reached 100,000 downloads across platforms.</li>
        <li>Delivered 75% user adoption in three months.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="results-reflection" class="case-study__block end-scroll-nav">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project reinforced the value of user research and rapid iteration. The analytics-first pivot, driven by user feedback, proved that data and empathy matter.</p>
      <p>By working closely with a cross-functional team, I delivered a mobile app that wasn’t just a smaller web version, but a tailored, intuitive tool merchants could rely on anytime, anywhere.</p>
      <p>Shipping fast and embracing tradeoffs helped us build a product that users truly loved.</p>
