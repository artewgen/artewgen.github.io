        <a class="link link--inline" target="_blank" href="https://yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> is one of the fastest-growing Russian multinational companies in the information technology industry.
      </p>  
      <h3 class="content__h3">Scope of work</h3>
      <p>
        Working with three internal teams (VConf, Staff and Femida) on tasks of different complexity: from creating illustrations to developing a new version of the services. During few months of work, I completed more than 20 tasks, half of them were already in production. 
      </p>
      
      <h3 class="content__h3">Responsibilities</h3>

      <p>
        VConf organizes meetings and broadcasts events, including the company's general meeting. Not only Yandex employees can participate in meetings, but also external users — to join, just open the link in the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Redesign of VConf was my most important project. Now it's one of the main tools of Yandex internal communication.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Problems</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the full transition of the company to VConf, a new version of the service was required. There was a request for new functionality and a more convenient interface for calling. An admin panel and an adaptive version were also required.
      </p>
       
      
          <h3 class="content__h3">Research</h3>   
          <ul>
