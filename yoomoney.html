        <h3 class="content__h3">Scope of work</h3>
        <p>
          During two years of my work, I redesigned projects such as the Embedded checkout form (Widget), Redirect form and Mobile SDK. Also, I created a design for the YooKassa management app for business.

      <ul>
        <li>defining goals and needs of the customers and business;</li>
        <li>identify pains and problems via user interviews and quantitative testing;</li>
        <li>taking an active role in the sprints planning for the front-end team for effective production of services and using scrum methodology;</li>
        <li>organizing infrastructure and components to improve quality of service and developing a design system;</li>

      <img class="content__pic" alt="Checkout widget redesign prototype" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-preview.gif">
      <p>
        <a class="link link--inline" target="_blank" href="https://yookassa.ru/widget/">YooMoney widget</a> 
        is the company's latest payment acceptance solution. It's a ready-made form for websites that provides seamless payments without switching to other tabs. The widget is used by Adidas & Reebok, iHerb, Renault and other big names.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Problems. Quality user testing</h3>
      <img class="content__pic" alt="Quality user testing reviews" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-reviews.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-reviews@2x.png 2x">
      <p class="points-header">
        Series of accumulated requests from businesses and users served as the incentive for the redesign. In the beginning, business requirements were collected:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>improve conversion rate;</li>
        <li>add new payment methods as SberPay and linked cards;</li>
        <li>add the ability to brand the appearance;</li>
        <li>improve scalability and add re-select payment methods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="points-header">
        User testing helped to identify the main UX design problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>improve highlighting of the selected method;</li>
        <li>fix the location of the payment button;</li>
        <li>make it easier to fill out a bank card details.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Quantitative user testing</h3>
      <img class="content__pic qt" alt="Quantitative user testing results" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-click-testing.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-click-testing@2x.png 2x">
      <p>
        The heatmap confirmed the concerns users expressed in their interviews. For instance, some of the users failed to understand which payment method was active and where they should click to commit the payment.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Finding a solution — three concepts</h3> 
      <p>
        To cover all of the widget redesign goals, three prototypes were made. Each of them was quantitatively tested, compared to the old design. The best version was selected as the final one.
      </p>
      <h4 class="content__h4">Concept 1. Updated old version</h4>
      <img class="content__pic" alt="Concept one" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-concept-one.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-concept-one@2x.png 2x">
      <p>Initially, there was an attempt to fix the previous version of the UI with placing accents on the chosen method and submit button.
        Thus, there was an attempt to correct consistency and to improve understanding the choice. 
        <p>
        User testing showed that the understanding of the chosen method has become better, but submit button was also poorly noticed. Also, in such a design, it would be difficult to fulfill the business goal of adding new methods without overflowing the design.
      </p>
      
        <h4 class="content__h4">Concept 2. Accordion</h4>
        <img class="content__pic" alt="Concept two" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-concept-two.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-concept-two@2x.png 2x">
        <p>After an unsuccessful try to fix the old design, it was decided to make new design concepts. An accordion was a quite good solution — payment methods were placed on separate cards and the details of the method were revealed in accordion style.</p>
        <p>Users understood of the chosen method good enough submit the button worked well too. The big problem was that the interface takes up a lot of space in height, which is problematic for an embedded solution.</p>
        <p>It's okay, but the interface takes up a lot of space in height, you need to scroll down</p>

      <h4 class="content__h4">Concept 3. Steps</h4>
      <img class="content__pic" alt="Concept three" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-concept-three.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-concept-three@2x.png 2x">
        <p>The previous concept was redesigned that the chosen method was opened by the next step. This concept worked perfectly on tests and was suitable for business purposes:
          <ul>
            <li>excellent user understanding of the selected method and the convenience of filling in on a separate screen;</li>
            <li>easy to add a new payment method and steps without overloading the design;</li>
            <li>compact size for embedding;</li>
            <li>convenient to reuse in other projects.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>All three concepts were tested on quantitative tests and the third concept with steps showed the best results. It was decided to take this into developing.</p>

        <h3 class="content__h3">New features</h3>
        <p>The widget stands out among the competitors in a positive way due to its adaptability for most devices and customization to match the colors of the merchant's website.</p>
        <h4 class="content__h4">Customization</h4>
        <img class="content__pic" alt="Widget customization" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-customization.gif" srcset="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-customization@2x.gif 2x">
        <p>The merchant can customize the color scheme — the widget takes the brand colors. It is possible to change the color of the "Pay" button, the color of the text or the background.
          According to metrics, stores with customized widget had a 15% higher conversion payment rate.</p>
       
        <h4 class="content__h4">Responsive</h4>
        <img class="content__pic" alt="Widget adaptive" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-adaptive.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-widget-adaptive@2x.png 2x">
        <p>Widget adapts to the screen resolutions of most devices. Therefore, it is equally convenient to pay via phone, tablet, or any laptop. You can pay via YooMoney widget even on a smart watch.</p>
        <h3 class="content__h3">Redesign results</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>major product and UX issues are closed;</b></li>
          <li><b>conversion rate increased by more than 5% ($2 million monthly turnover);</b></li>
          <li><b>new features: loyalty, scalability, re-election etc;</b></li>
          <li><b>the concept of the widget was re-used in more than 8 company projects.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="content__h3">Real widget examples</h3>
        <p>
          More than thousand of merchants integrate the widget to their websites — from little stores to multi-million services.

      <img class="content__pic" alt="Yookassa app example" src="assets/pic/case-yoomoney-lk-onboarding.svg">  
      <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/юkassa/id1536936120" class="link link--inline">YooKassa app</a> is a payment management center for merchants. It's an easy way to manage payments, issue invoices, make refunds, monitor payment and invoice analytics.</p>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Problems</h3>
      <p>Initially, there was only a web version of the personal account of YooKassa users without adaptive version. Many requests were received from merchants for the mobile version. Adding an adaptive version of the website to make it convenient was technically difficult, so it was decided to make a mobile application on iOS and Android and tablet version for iPad.</p>
      <p class="points-header">During interviews with users, the main features for the application were identified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>analytics for payments and invoices;</li>
        <li>full control over payments with filtering;</li>
        <li>refunds and fast invoicing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="content__h3">Solution</h3>

      <h4 class="content__h4">Analytics</h4>
      <p>In the first version of the application, the main section was a list of payments, and analytics was on the second tab. After launching and collecting the first reviews, it became clear that users more often go for analytics than for a list of payments, so in the next version analytics became the main. 
      <p>The analytics included nine parameters: revenue, average check, amount and number of refunds, number of payments, paid bills and average bill receipt, invoices issued and unpaid bills.</p>

      <p>List of payments with details was basic information for merchants. They received full control over payments: confirm or cancel them and browse payment history with search and details for each transaction.</p>

        <p>Fast invoicing via email, a text message, or a link was developed. The buyer would receive a payment link directly and would be able to pay immediately. After paying the bill, the merchant received a push notification.
        <p>Merchant can do full or partial refunds for an unpaid invoices or set a date after which it cannot be paid.</p>
