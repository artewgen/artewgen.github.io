      <h1>Streamlined the User Interviews Process, Cutting Testing Time from Weeks to Days</h1>
      <div class="case-study__top__description">
        <p>Working with my product manager, I launched a new user interview process at Tinkoff Bank that reduced testing time from weeks to days. Set up an efficient system to quickly find the right users to interview for any research need. Conducted 80+ interviews across 20 cycles, delivering reliable feedback that helped launch a successful product with 32% retention.</a>
        <p>
          Promoted this method across the department, enabling over 15 product teams to adopt it and accelerate decision-making.

    <div id="problem" class="case-study__block">
      <div id="start-scroll-nav"></div>
      <h2>Problem: Missing User Feedback in Design</h2>
      <p>When I joined Tinkoff Bank as a product designer, it was evident that testing with real users wasn’t working as it should. At Yandex, my previous company, user research was part of our everyday workflow—designers and researchers teamed up to ensure every idea was checked with actual users.</p>
      <p>At Tinkoff, concept tests took weeks, as the research team constantly dealt with many important projects. Most designers lacked an efficient way to rapidly test their ideas, releasing many solutions without genuine user feedback.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="start" class="case-study__block top-space">
      <h2>How We Started and Found the Right Respondents</h2>
      <p>When we started working on a new personal finance assistant, I teamed up with my product manager to conduct user interviews. In each round, talking to 4–5 users was usually enough to identify interface problems or test our ideas early on.</p>
      <p>The main challenge was sourcing the right respondents for mobile app testing—people without technical backgrounds or prior experience with our product. While developers and designers were readily available, their deep familiarity with digital products made their feedback less objective and more like that of “expert users.”</p>
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap rounded">
        <img src="../assets/pic/process/interview/testing.png" 
                srcset="../assets/pic/process/interview/testing.png 1x, 
                ../assets/pic/process/interview/testing@2x.png 2x"
                loading="lazy" alt="" class="img" />
      </div>
      <p>To reduce bias, I recruited newcomer customer support colleagues as interview participants. They closely resembled real users and provided neutral feedback, making recruitment quick and effective.</p>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">⏱️</span>Respondents were recruited within a day. Customer support colleagues were reliable and quick to agree to interviews, almost always showing up—unlike external users, who were much less consistent. This turned out to be a highly effective solution.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="customers" class="case-study__block top-space">
      <h2>Finding Specific Respondents Among Real Users</h2>
      <p>Occasionally, we faced situations where testing with users with specific knowledge or a unique set of banking products was necessary. For example, we needed feedback from customers who actively managed several savings accounts or new customers who had just opened an investment account.</p>
      <p>These user profiles were not always available among customer support colleagues, so I used Tableau analytics to identify and reach out to real app users who matched our criteria. With Tinkoff’s large user base, reaching suitable customers was easy and could be done within a few days.</p>
      <p>By sourcing suitable respondents, I refined FinHealth’s design through seven main screen iterations, testing with 35+ users from first-time savers to seasoned investors—delivering feedback that helped launch a <a href="../case/finhealth.html">successful product with 32% retention</a>.

    </div>
    <div id="scaling" class="case-study__block top-space">
      <h2>Scaling Interview Practice Across Teams</h2>
      <p>
        After a dozen successful interview cycles and further process refinement within the team, testing time was reduced to one week.
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap">
        <img src="../assets/pic/process/interview/schedule.svg">
      </div>
      <p>Once polished within our team, we began promoting this method across the mobile department, which included over 15 product teams.</p>
      <p>To help teams quickly adopt the new interview process, I took several steps:</p>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Documented the entire workflow and created a step-by-step guide.</li>
        <li>Set up a dedicated chat and assigned coordinators to streamline respondent recruitment for all teams.</li>
        <li>Introduced a chatbot to manage requests efficiently.</li>
        <li>Developed invitation email templates to further simplify the process.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap rounded rounded-s  bordered">
        <img src="../assets/pic/process/interview/mail.png" 
                srcset="../assets/pic/process/interview/mail.png 1x, 
                ../assets/pic/process/interview/mail@2x.png 2x"

      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="interview-guidelines" class="case-study__block top-space">
      <h2>Guidelines for Effective User Interviews</h2>  
      <p>To support effective interviews, I developed detailed guidelines and a script based on my interview experience, highlighting key principles:</p>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li><strong>Define clear objectives for each session:</strong> E.g., focus on testing a new feature or validating assumptions about user behaviour.</li>
        <li><strong>Recruit participants matching your target users:</strong> If building product for investors, prioritise actual investors over internal staff.</li>
        <li><strong>Begin with introductions and warm-up questions:</strong> Start with, “Can you describe how you use finance apps?” to help participants feel comfortable.</li>
        <li><strong>Record only with consent and clarify confidentiality:</strong> Say, “May I record this session? It’s confidential and for internal use only.”</li>
        <li><strong>Use open-ended, neutral questions:</strong> Ask, “What did you think about onboarding?” not “Was onboarding easy for you?”</li>
        <li><strong>Pause and use follow-up questions for depth:</strong> After an answer, ask, “Can you tell me why you chose that?” or “What did you expect to happen next?”</li>
        <li><strong>Summarise to confirm understanding:</strong> Reflect, “So, you were unsure how to set a savings goal in the app, is that right?”</li>
        <li><strong>Encourage final comments and clarify next steps:</strong> End with, “Anything else you’d like to add?” and a brief explanation of how their feedback will be used.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I also detailed how to analyse interviews and provided templates for organising results in spreadsheets. This made it easier for other teams to adopt and scale the practice efficiently.</p>
    <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">📈</span>Within a year, every team was testing their solutions, with dozens of respondent requests regularly routed through the chatbot for interviews.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="insights" class="case-study__block top-space">
      <h2>Insights for Mobile Testing</h2>
      <p>Initially, I tested prototypes by sharing my desktop and asking users to describe their actions. Later, I sent links for users to open prototypes on their own phones and share screens via Zoom or Google Meet. This led to more realistic feedback and allowed testing of real interactions like taps and swipes.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>More natural user behaviour;</li>
        <li>Ability to test gestures and animations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Some respondents struggled to join from their phone, open prototypes, or share screens;</li>
        <li>Figma browser bars reduced realism of native app;</li>
        <li>Sometimes prototypes displayed inconsistently or incorrectly across user devices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Afterwards, I explored the Figma Mirror app for seamless full-screen testing, which resolved most prototype display issues, although it does require respondents to install the app in advance.

    </div>
    <div id="achievements" class="case-study__block top-space">
      <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <p>
        This new user interview process delivered measurable impact at both product and organisational levels, setting a new standard for evidence-driven design. Key achievements include:
      </p>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Reduced user testing time from weeks to days by introducing a streamlined respondent sourcing and interview system.</li>
        <li>Enabled over 15 product teams to adopt the process in just one year, embedding rapid user feedback into ongoing development.</li>
        <li>Conducted over 80 interviews across 20+ cycles, ensuring dependable insights at every product stage.</li>
        <li>Improved the reliability of usability insights by recruiting unbiased customer support colleagues and targeting specialised user segments through analytics.</li>
        <li>Created comprehensive documentation, step-by-step interview guides, and automated request tools (chatbots, unified email templates) to scale with minimal friction.</li>
        <li>Set a benchmark for efficient, scalable research that raised the overall product development quality across the department.</li>
      </ul>
