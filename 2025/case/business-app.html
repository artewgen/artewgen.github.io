      <h2>Merchant Problems: Mobile Access Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        Initially, YooMoney offered only a web-based merchant account with no mobile or adaptive versions, leaving merchants frustrated by the lack of on-the-go access to essential tasks. 
      <p>  
        Me and my manager surveyed around 120 merchants, where demand for a mobile app or adaptive solution emerged as the top feature request, with one-third specifically highlighting the need for mobile access.
      </p>  
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap">
        <img src="../assets/pic/case/business-app/survey.svg">
      </div>
      <p>
        Since simply making the website adaptive wasn’t technically feasible, dedicated mobile apps were developed for iOS, Android, and iPad.</p>
      <p>Then, about 20 user interviews were conducted, revealing merchants’ most important needs for mobile access:</p>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Instant access to payment and sales analytics.</li>
        <li>Full control over payments with advanced search and filtering.</li>
        <li>Fast, seamless creation of invoices and processing of refunds.</li>
        <li>Direct access to customer support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">🧭</span>This research shaped a roadmap, ensuring the mobile apps delivered meaningful value rather than just a scaled-down web experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-adaptation" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Adaptation: Rethinking Business Tools for Mobile</h2>
      <p>
        When transitioning the established YooMoney web service to mobile, the challenge was not to recreate desktop workflows but to thoughtfully reimagine core business management functionalities for mobile devices' constraints and unique possibilities.
      <p>
        Instead of simply copying web layouts, I reimagined the information architecture and prioritised high-frequency actions like analytics, payments, and invoicing. This meant simplifying navigation, designing gesture-based interactions, and optimising onboarding for speed. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-analytics" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Analytics in Focus</h2>
      <p>In the initial release, the main screen displayed a list of payments, with analytics on the second tab. From early user reviews, I learned that merchants were accessing analytics more frequently than the payments list. In response, analytics was moved to the primary position in the next update, and users welcomed the change.</p>
      <div class="centered-wrap rounded rounded-l no-margins no-paddings">
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="../assets/pic/case/business-app/analytics-general.svg">
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The analytics dashboard featured nine key metrics: revenue, average bill amount, number of refunds and their total amount, number of payments, paid bills, average bill receipt, invoices issued, and unpaid bills.</p>
      <p>Users especially appreciated the ability to compare data via an interactive chart that could be expanded in horizontal mode—a feature that received consistently high ratings and positive feedback.</p>
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap">
        <img src="../assets/pic/case/business-app/analytics-vertical.svg">
      </div>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">📈</span> Many merchants shared that they opened the app first thing in the morning to check analytics, treating it as their business dashboard. After moving analytics to the main screen, daily active sessions increased by 35%.
    </div>
    <div id="rd-payments" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Fast Payment Actions</h2>
      <p>The payments section provided merchants with a comprehensive, searchable list of all transactions, putting essential information at their fingertips. Merchants could confirm or cancel payments, review detailed histories, and search for specific transactions easily.</p>
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap">
        <img src="../assets/pic/case/business-app/payments.svg">
      </div>
      <p>Users could view a full timeline of each payment, including its status, receipt details, and any refunds. The ability to quickly view and send receipts proved especially valuable, becoming one of merchants' most requested and well-used features.</p>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">🎯</span> A lot of users highlighted frustration with web-based workflows that buried transaction details several clicks deep. Surfacing this data on one screen and enabling actions with minimal taps was a major usability win on mobile.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-invoicing" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Instant Invoicing and Refunds</h2>
      <p>The app made invoicing fast and effortless—merchants could generate and send invoices instantly via email, SMS, or a direct link, allowing buyers to pay on the spot from any device. Once a payment was received, the merchant was notified with a push notification, keeping cash flow up to date in real time.</p>
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap">
        <img src="../assets/pic/case/business-app/invoce-refund.svg">
      </div>
      <p>Merchants also had the flexibility to issue full or partial refunds and could set expiration dates for invoices, preventing payments after a specified deadline.</p>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">⏱️</span> User research showed that merchants wasted time tracking unpaid invoices on desktops. The app helped them speed up payment collection by streamlining invoicing and adding real-time mobile notifications.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-support" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Real-Time Merchant Support</h2>
      <p>Through feedback from user interviews, I added real-time support chat to the app. This allowed merchants to get help without leaving their workflow and made support faster and more effective by letting them send messages, screenshots, and transaction details directly to the support team.</p>
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap">
        <img src="../assets/pic/case/business-app/support.svg">
      </div>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">💬</span> By embedding chat within the mobile app, average support response times were reduced by 35%, and merchant satisfaction scores increased significantly.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="rd-widgets" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Widgets with Instant Metrics</h2>
      <p>During the app launch, iOS introduced the SmartStack feature, making it much easier for users to add and customise widgets on their devices. Seizing this opportunity, I designed a dozen widget variations to show key business metrics and payment details right on the home screen. These widgets quickly became popular with merchants and proved to be an effective marketing tool.</p>
      <div class="centered-wrap rounded rounded-l no-margins no-paddings">
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="../assets/pic/case/business-app/widgets.svg">
        </div>
      </div>  
     </div>
    <div id="rd-tablet" class="case-study__block">
      <h2>Tablet Version</h2>
      <p>Merchants frequently requested a tablet version, as many managed operations and reviewed analytics on larger screens during meetings or on the go. 
        Introducing a tablet-optimised solution enabled users to manage complex workflows with greater efficiency and drove higher engagement among businesses using tablet devices.</p>
        <div class="centered-wrap rounded rounded-l no-margins no-paddings">
