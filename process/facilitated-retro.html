      <h1>Facilitated 10+ retrospectives, improving developer team efficiency by 30%</h1>
      <div class="case-study__top__description">
        <p>I initiated regular retrospective meetings with my development team, turning informal problem-solving into an effective practice that increased team efficiency by 30%. Leveraging a designer‚Äôs mindset, empathy, and a playful approach, I facilitated over 10 tailored sessions that fostered a culture of openness and continuous improvement. My approach was later adopted by other teams, enhancing collaboration and delivery company-wide.

      <h2>Problem: Lost Opportunities Without Retros</h2>
      <p>The mindset at B√Ørch leaned towards solving problems on the fly, with few seeing the benefit of structured retrospectives. There was a clear concern that adding another meeting might become a routine checkbox exercise with little value. As a result, recurring issues and team achievements often went unrecognised, and valuable lessons were overlooked.</p>
      <p>I encouraged the team to adopt regular retrospectives, highlighting their value for celebrating achievements and driving real improvement. The first session, centred on shoutouts, quickly proved the impact of this structured approach and shifted the team‚Äôs mindset.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="effective-retros" class="case-study__block top-space">
      <h2>Effective Retrospectives</h2>
      <p>Each retrospective was structured to maximise engagement and psychological safety while also injecting a sense of fun, an essential ingredient for successful online meetings. Sessions were held on Google Meet, with all collaboration happening on interactive Figma boards that were playfully tailored to our team and product topics.
      <p>
      
        <p>A typical agenda included:</p>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>A brief team warm-up to encourage openness.</li>
        <li>Shoutouts for individual and team achievements.</li>
        <li>Sharing challenges and areas for improvement.</li>
        <li>Grouping and prioritising challenges and improvements through voting.</li>
        <li>Collaborative brainstorming for solution ideas.</li>
        <li>Assigning action items with clear ownership.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap">
        <img src="../assets/pic/process/retro/process.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="img" />
      </div>
      <p>By keeping sessions well timeboxed and fostering an open environment, each retro lasted roughly 90 minutes and occurred every 4‚Äì8 weeks to balance reflection and ongoing delivery.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="engaging-experience" class="case-study__block rounded top-space">
      <h2>Creating Engaging Experience</h2>
      <p>I aimed to make each retrospective enjoyable and informal, so everyone felt at ease and engaged. For our ‚ÄúCHIPs‚Äù team, I created a custom Figma board with crisp-themed characters and brought crisps into the office. As an icebreaker, everyone chose the crisp character matching their mood, creating a positive, open atmosphere that encouraged honest participation.</p>
      <div class="case-study__image-wrap rounded">
        <img src="../assets/pic/process/retro/chips.svg">
      </div>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">üéØ</span>I‚Äôm convinced that a creative warm-up helps build trust and encourages even quieter colleagues to share, leading to more open and productive discussions.</p>
      <div class="centered-wrap no-margins no-paddings bottom-margin">
        <div class="centered">
          <img src="../assets/pic/process/retro/workspaces.png"

          >
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>I designed every meeting with a unique thematic experience. For the launch of workspaces, the board crafted a space theme with spaceships, while the billing page release included a money motif. Aligning each session‚Äôs design with current product milestones kept retrospectives fresh, relevant, and enjoyable.</p>
      <p>These details made retros more memorable and built team cohesion. As the format became familiar, facilitation became easier, and the value of collaboration became clear.</p>

    <div id="lifehacks" class="case-study__block top-space">
      <h2>Practical Lifehacks</h2>
      <p>Through facilitating these retrospectives, I uncovered a multitude of practical insights and effective approaches:
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li><strong>Keep an eye on the timing:</strong> There‚Äôs always a risk of retros running long or drifting off topic. I use built-in digital timers in Figma to keep each discussion segment on track, announcing timeboxes upfront and signalling when time‚Äôs nearly up. I keep the session flexible if a topic needs a few extra minutes, but avoid letting any one issue dominate.</li>
        <li><strong>Action Point Ownership:</strong> Assigning clear owners to each action item ensures nothing gets forgotten. I always start each session by reviewing the previous actions, so everyone stays accountable and progress is easy to see.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-Stage Sessions:</strong> The first retro, or retros held after a long gap, often bring up more topics than one session can handle productively. When the agenda is too crowded or issues are especially complex, I split the retrospective across two shorter meetings: one focused on surfacing problems and feelings, the other dedicated to solutioning. This avoids fatigue and keeps input fresh.</li>
        <li><strong>Set the Mood with Music:</strong> A feel-good playlist makes the session more welcoming and relaxed. Figma‚Äôs timer includes optional background music to boost focus during idea generation. Those who prefer can mute it individually. This simple touch helps create a comfortable, open space for sharing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">üéØ</span>These approaches have made each retrospective more constructive, efficient, and energising, ensuring the process delivers lasting value instead of becoming a routine checkbox exercise.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="improvement" class="case-study__block top-space">
      
      <h2>Driving Team Improvement</h2>
      <p>Retrospectives enabled everyone to speak up, celebrate achievements, and tackle challenges together, making collaboration easier and more enjoyable.</p>
      <p>For instance, after a tough launch, a retrospective provided a safe space to discuss difficulties and generate ideas for better planning and focus. The following launch was noticeably smoother and more rewarding.</p>
      <p>Achievements:
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li><strong>30% Efficiency Gain:</strong> Delivery rose from 8‚Äì9 to 11‚Äì12 story points per sprint, driven by sharper prioritisation, more transparent communication, and actionable insights from retrospectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Accountability:</strong> Before retros, action items were often missed. Afterwards, nearly all were closed due to more substantial ownership, greater team engagement, and routine progress checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Broader Impact:</strong> Other teams soon adopted my approach, strengthening collaboration and delivery across the company wide.</li>
      </ul>
      <div id="end-scroll-nav"></div>
      
      <p class="highlight"><span class="highlight__icon">üçü</span>Our retrospectives didn‚Äôt just improve our metrics, they brought our team closer, made problem-solving more enjoyable, and proved that a little creativity can make all the difference. Continuous improvement has become part of our routine, plus there‚Äôs always an excuse for a celebratory bag of crisps!</p>
