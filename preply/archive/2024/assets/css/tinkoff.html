        <p>
          Financial Health service is a part of Personal Financial Management in the Tinkoff app. This innovative
          feature provides financial metrics encompassing personal finance management, savings and expenditure, credit
          scores, and investment options.
        <p>
          FinHealth ensures personalised advice and insights for improving financial well-being and educates users on
          smart money management practices, including profitable bill payments, responsible borrowing and saving, along with
          strategic investing.
        <p>
          My team and I achieved a 40% customer retention rate to the FinHealth service, inspired 10% of clients to open additional accounts in the bank, and increased financial 
          literacy with 30% of clients. Given the concept's success, it was subsequently adapted to create Financial Health in the business app.

        <h3 class="content__h3">My role</h3>
        <p class="points-header">
        <p>I have been involved in the project since the very beginning. Initially, the team consisted only of the
          product manager and me, and we created the concept together.
        <p>After the concept was ready, we assembled a complete iOS and Android development team.
        <p>As the only designer on the project, my responsibilities encompass product analytics, research, testing,
          interface development, and maintaining the design library.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Why it started</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-preview.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-preview@2x.png 2x">

        <p>The concept for this project had been contemplated several times within the company, but initiating it proved
          challenging. Eventually, the project kicked off, driven by the business's and its customers' needs.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Customer needs</h3>
        <p>Initially, it was hypothesized that customers need a <strong>general understanding of their finances for
            control and security.</strong> This was confirmed through in-depth interviews and identified as their
          primary goal.
        <p>Examples of users needs from interviews:
        <ul>
          <li>"When buying something valuable, I need to know my total funds and if I can afford it;"</li>
          <li>"When planning a vacation, I need to know my current savings rate and if adjustments are needed."</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="content__h3">Business needs</h3>
        <p>Business goals included increasing client retention, measured by the sticky factor, and cross-selling to
          current customers, focusing on boosting financial literacy to enhance customer well-being and business
          revenue.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>boost client engagement and loyalty</strong> — strengthen customer relations, enhancing
            satisfaction and loyalty;</li>
          <li><strong>integration with other services</strong> — integrate with other app products for a broader range
            of solutions for users;</li>
          <li><strong>enhance financial literacy</strong> — educate clients on managing personal finances to improve
            their ecomomic status.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content__h3">Target audience</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-target-audience.png"
          srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-target-audience@2x.png 2x">

        <p>My PM and I conducted an analysis according to the intentions and thriving savings capital on 12 million
          customers.
          According to the results of analytics, there were three main segments:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A tiny part of customers (6%)</strong> can save and have impressive capital;</li>
          <li><strong>A small part (12%)</strong> who are trying to save money and do it a little;</li>
          <li><strong>Most customers (82%)</strong> spend all income, those who are not trying to save.</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-target-audience-charts.png"
          srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-target-audience-charts@2x.png 2x">

        <p>We chose an audience focused on active savers or those who can save a small yet financially capable segment.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Competitor analysis</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-competitors.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-competitors@2x.png 2x">

        <p>I conducted a competitive analysis of money trackers, personal finance management tools, and neo-banks. I
          analyzed more than 25 competitors and identified over 30 distinct features.
        <p>With the PM, we selected features that matched our goals, sorted them based on our implementation timeline, and organized them by priority and complexity: 
          
        <ul>
          <li><strong>immediate developing</strong> — displaying total funds across all accounts, tracking savings, and
            showing invested amounts;</li>
          <li><strong>intermediate</strong> — credit rating, subscription management, financial literacy tools, and a
            comprehensive view of capital;</li>
          <li><strong>long-term features</strong> — detailed savings goals, financial predictions, and social profile
            integration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content__h3">Main tools: metrics and ideas</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-metrics-ideas.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-metrics-ideas@2x.png 2x">

        <p>In analyzing the problem of users needing a sense of control, we identified two fundamental entities: metrics
          with ratings and ideas for their improvement. This functionality has been effective in influencing users'
          perception of control.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Metrics</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-metrics.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-metrics@2x.png 2x">

        <p>
          Financial metrics help clients understand their overall financial state. These metrics change monthly,
          encouraging clients to check them regularly. Due to this, our retention rate was 40% after launch.
        <p>
          We selected metrics based on user testing, focusing on simplicity and understandability:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>total account balance;</strong></li>
          <li><strong>savings rate;</strong></li>
          <li><strong>credit rating;</strong></li>
          <li><strong>invested funds.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We categorized metric statuses from low to ideal, avoiding negative terms in favour of "quite good" based on
          user feedback against harsh financial evaluations. For corner cases like "Insufficient Data," we suggest
          improvement opportunities rather than label them negatively.
        <h3 class="content__h3">Main screen iterations</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-variants.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-variants@2x.png 2x">

        <p>Metrics are displayed on the main screen of FinHealth. There were challenges in determining the best way to
          present them. Various options were explored, with some interesting ones highlighted: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a combined rating seemed like a great idea, but it had many drawbacks;</li>
          <li>grouping metrics and adding ideas made it complex to understand;</li>
          <li>a concept involving additions was close to the final choice, but since it was decided not to show ideas on
            the main screen and only display metrics, a compact design was unnecessary;</li>
          <li>ultimately, my PM and I settled on a tremendous vertical block display, which addresses all issues and has
            no apparent drawbacks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content__h3">Metric Screen</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-metric-screen.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-metric-screen@2x.png 2x">

        <p>All metric screens are consistent and include similar blocks. Metric detailed information, charts, and
          benchmarks help clients understand their current status in detail. The ideas block aids in improving the
          metric, while related articles enhance financial literacy.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Charts</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-charts.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-charts@2x.png 2x">

        <p>
          There are wave and column charts. It took a very long time to decide how to display details on the charts — I
          tried placing the numbers above the columns, inside the columns, and even on the coordinate axis, but we
          didn't like any of the variants. We decided to keep the graphs clean and show additional information upon
          tapping.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Benchmark block</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-benchmark.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-benchmark@2x.png 2x">
        <p>The benchmark block displays the client's current status relative to the interval and status we have
          selected. We convert the estimate into understandable values. </p>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-benchmark-details.png"
          srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-benchmark-details@2x.png 2x">
        <p>For instance, regarding general finances — "How long will the money last if income stops?". For savings and
          investments — "What percentage of income is being saved?". The reason for using percentages is that they
          provide a clearer picture of financial health. For example, saving one thousand out of ten thousand (10%) is
          good. However, saving one thousand out of a hundred thousand (1%) is insufficient for effective saving.
        <h3 class="content__h3">Ideas block</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-idea.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-idea@2x.png 2x">
        <p>Previous blocks help clients understand their status. 'Personal Ideas' can assist customers in improving
          their status, well-being, and financial literacy. Additionally, these ideas support business needs by
          promoting internal cross-selling of products.
        </p>

          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-ideas.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-ideas@2x.png 2x">
        <p> With the assistance of the marketing department, we have developed over 40 ideas.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Articles</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-article.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-article@2x.png 2x">

        <p>
          Tinkoff publishes a comprehensive Finance Journal with more than 20 million monthly readers. We displayed articles on the metrics screen to help clients improve their financial literacy. It
          also works well for retention.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Dark theme</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"

        <p>That's all about design blocks. And check out how cool the dark theme looks 😁

        <h3 class="content__h3">First launch</h3>
        <p>To quickly test the main metrics and gather feedback, we launched a simple MVP (Minimum Viable Product), the
          bare minimum needed for an initial market offering to be viable.</p>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="Financial Health preview"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-mvp-retention.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-mvp-retention@2x.png 2x">
        <p>Thanks to the rapid launch, we checked the retention rate metric, which is impressive, especially for the
          minimal version — 40%.
        <p>We identified technical bugs in metric calculations, such as misclassified transfers to shared accounts as
          monthly spending. User interviews revealed issues like a preference for long-tap interactions with charts,
          which was evident in the internal release.
        <p>The prosperous beta launch confirmed the necessity of continuing development and launching the full version.

        <h3 class="content__h3">Final results</h3>
        <p>
          After an effective beta launch, our team refined the product to full functionality and effectively ran the
          entire release.
          </p>

          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-results.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-results@2x.png 2x">

        
        <p>
          I’m proud to share the results we could achieve with the team in a year of work:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>boost client engagement and loyalty</strong> — reach a 40% retention rate for FinHealth and
            increase overall app retention by up to 5%;</li>
          <li><strong>superb cross-selling</strong> — more than 10% of clients opened additional debit,
            credit and investment products through FinHealth;</li>
          <li><strong>enhance financial literacy</strong> — more than 30% of the FinHealth clients started reading
            articles on the topic of financial health;</li>
          <li><strong>reuse a proven idea</strong> — the success of the FinHealth for individual clients prompted the
            development of financial health for corporate clients.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="content__h3">Future plans</h3>
        <p>The following features we planned with the product manager to introduce in FinHealth:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>subscription manager</strong>— highly demanded functionality that we had started to develop;</li>
          <li><strong>capital editing</strong>— adding money from other banks, real estate and other savings to the metric of all money;</li>
          <li><strong>smart savings goals</strong>— assistance in effective planning and tracking the achievement of financial goals;</li>
          <li><strong>social profiles</strong>— to facilitate social finance interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content__h3">Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I participated in creating a product from scratch and actively immersed myself in product work — from
          identifying the needs of businesses and users, researching and interviewing, analyzing data-launching projects
          from Amplitude, and formulating hypotheses of improved service.
        <p>
          During the year of project development, I learned a lot of new things and faced with numerous challenging
          issues:
        <ul>
          <li>My collaboration with the product manager was productive and outstanding. We established our working process, provided regular feedback, and divided research tasks during the concept phase. I gained valuable insights into working with products through our collaboration.</li>
          <li>The project depended on many teams since FinHealth is a tool that consolidates all other products. We had numerous dependencies and approvals but established excellent and swift communication, never losing sight of anything.</li>
          <li>During the concept phase, we explored multiple versions, tested various options, and arrived at the final solution. This way, we found the perfect implementation.</li>
          <li>The company needed to have a user interface testing process. We streamlined this process and conducted nearly a hundred interviews.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="content__h3">Additional: UX interview process</h3>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="UX interview process"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-interviews.png" srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-interviews@2x.png 2x">
        <p>
          I prefer to test my design solutions with users to genuinely understand how the product will work on the
          target audience.
        <p>I learned this at Yandex and applied it at Tinkoff. The company had issues with research, so together with
          the PM, we invented a fast and convenient UX interview process.
        </p>
        <img class="content__pic image_with_wrap" alt="UX interview process"
          src="assets/pic/case-finhealth-interview-process.png"
          srcset="assets/pic/case-finhealth-interview-process@2x.png 2x">
        <p>
          As a result, we reduced the hypothesis testing time <strong>from several weeks to just a few days.</strong>
          User testing had become more accessible, and most teams utilized our process. I've conducted over 80
          interviews.
